# Scripts
A repository for all the scripts I have written. So far, these have only been written to aid with grading at University of Victoria, where I am a teaching assistant.

filename | description
--- | ---
rename.py | changes directory structure and renames folders as needed
test-student | tests student's sql output against a solution.txt output
cat-ans | prints out the solution.txt, the student's solution output, and the student's SQL code
